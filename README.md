# AutomaticFaceSmoothing
 
The module is used to automatically apply facial smoothing technique to images in given path.

Currently, the module used openCV frontal face detection to detect faces and apply bilateral filter to detected faces.

# To do

- [x] implement facial recognition
- [x] implement smoothing filter
- [ ] test
- [ ] finish documentation
- [ ] further implement more techniques (check [AN ALGORITHM FOR AUTOMATIC SKIN SMOOTHING IN DIGITAL PORTRAITS](https://projet.liris.cnrs.fr/imagine/pub/proceedings/ICIP-2009/pdfs/0003149.pdf))
